# Stats-112-Final-Project

In our study, we aim to analyze reflection papers from each group on the guest speaker Ms. Susan Philips. We are interested in identifying the underlying common themes among each group’s different understanding of the chapters about individuals immigrating to the U.S. and Ms. Phillip’s talk. To do this, we utilized text mining techniques such as frequency graphs, and word clouds. For our data model, we used text networks, a cluster dendrogram, and LDA topics modeling to find common and significant words in the reflection papers.
